# Custom wp installer
Tired of installing Wordpress and spending 30 minutes to configure the same options? Save time by storing and reusing your installation options.

IMPORTANT ADVICE: this software has been designed as a tool for my use only and, for this reason, I did not followed any coding standard rules neigher well tested the code, just a piece of code in order to save time when I install and configure WP by myself. Then, it is intended to be used only by skilled programmers that know what they are doing and be able to avoid damages and review the code before use it.
